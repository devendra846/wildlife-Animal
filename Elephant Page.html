            Elephant
        </h2>

        <p>
            Elephants are animals that belong to the Elephantidae family (which includes mammoths) can be found all over
            the world.Elephants are one of the world's largest land animals, with
            populations spanning Asia and Africa's forests and deserts. Elephants are known to be highly intelligent and
            social animals, similar to primates and humans, and are regarded as the most
            lovable creatures and valued by various cultures around the world.


        </p>
        <p>
            Elephants have 1.5-2 inch length and 1-inch broad eyes. Because of the location of the eyeball, the
            existence of the trunk and ear, as well as the short neck, the field of vision is limited to just 30-50
            metres. When an elephant detects danger, it alternates its body movements from side to side to see behind it
            rather than travelling straight forward. However, this is offset by exceptionally strong olfactory and
            hearing abilities.


        </p>
        <p>
            Elephants are also used to hunt tigers. On the back of the elephant, the hunter is in the ‘howdah,' which is
            pushed and led by the driver, ‘Mahawat.'


            Elephants were used in wars in the past, and armies had their regiments of trained warrior elephants. They
            can still be seen in state processions. A large number of elephants are captured alive to be tamed and
            trained.


            According to a Scientific American article, elephants are among the most intelligent animals on the planet,
            and they have been found to have varying degrees of problem-solving abilities, as well as the capacity to
            display and experience empathy, mourning, and self-awareness.

            <p>
            <ul>
                The Asian elephant is an ‘endangered’ species according to the IUCN Red List. There are various reasons
                for the rapid decline of the
                elephant population – <br> <br>

                <li>
                    <b>No room to roam: </b> loss and fragmentation is the greatest threat to wild Asian Elephants.
                    Rapid increase in industrialization and human development projects are clearing their habitat,
                    pushing the elephants to less suitable environments.
                </li>
                <li> <b>Human-elephant conflict:</b> Due to shrinking habitats, elephants are forced to stray into human
                    settlements in search of food and water which sometimes results in damage to property or even human
                    lives. Retaliation by the people affected by these incidents often result in killing of these
                    elephants.</li>

                <li>
                    <b> Ivory Poaching:</b> The international ivory trade has contributed to the poaching of male
                    elephants
                    (bulls) for their tusks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b> Illegal trafficking and capturing of young elephants:</b> Elephant calves are separated from
                    their
                    mother and poached from the wild to be used in entertainment industries such as circuses, weddings,
                    processions and even temples. In the process, mothers are usually killed attempting to protect their
                    young.

                ELEPHANT MEMORIAL
            </h2>

            <p>
                In 2019, Wildlife SOS established India’s first Elephant Memorial to commemorate the elephants who lost
                their lives fighting the battle of brutality with every speck of strength that they possessed. The
                Elephant Memorial is a first of its kind in India, as we pledge to never forget the sacrifice of these
                gentle giants who laid down their lives after suffering at the hands of humanity. The elephants who are
                no longer here with us have taught us strength, resilience and bravery, and these lessons will never be
                forgotten, as they inspire us each moment of our lives and keep us driven in our spirit.


                The memorial not only looks back upon the fallen soldiers, it also celebrates their healing journey with
                us. We look up to Luna, Lakhi, Gajraj, Bella, Mohan, Sita and Champa as their martyrdom keeps us united
                in spirit.
