        <h1>About Us</h1><br>
        <p>Wildlife refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all organisms that
            grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans. Wildlife was also
            synonymous to game: those birds and mammals that were hunted for sport. Wildlife can be found
            in all ecosystems. Deserts, plains, grasslands, woodlands, forests, and other areas including
            the most developed urban areas, all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture
            usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife is
            affected by human activities. Some wildlife threaten human safety, health, property and quality of
            life. However, many wild animals, even the dangerous ones, have value to human beings. This value might
            be economic, educational, or emotional in nature.

            Humans have historically tended to separate civilization from wildlife in a number of ways, including
            the legal, social and moral senses. Some animals, however, have adapted to suburban environments. This
            includes such animals as feral cats, dogs, mice, and rats. Some religions declare certain animals to
            be sacred, and in modern times, concern for the natural environment has
            provoked activists to protest against the exploitation of wildlife for human benefit or entertainment.</p>
        <p>Deforestation is also a major cause of wildlife loss. Mass murders of wild animals
            are taking place all over the globe for their meat, bones, fur, teeth, hair, skin,
            etc. The need for conservation of wildlife has now become a necessity.</p>

        <p>Population growth, agricultural and livestock development, urban and road building, and pollution are
            among the many pressures on wildlife’s natural habitat. In addition to illegal hunting, the decrease of
            habitat and its degradation has endangered the biodiversity of the widespread areas.</p>

        <p> Wildlife preservation does not imply blanket protection for all species of fauna and flora; rather, it
            means adequate, judicious control over the multiplication of crops and animals that communicate to provide
            a suitable atmosphere for the man whose very life is at risk today.</p>
        <p>
            In the past, due to the irrational use of the earth’s natural and biotic resources, most wildlife was
            demolished after recovery. It is our immediate responsibility to safeguard the ecosystem’s natural
            splendor and to develop a system of coexistence with every living creature on earth.</p>

        <p>While the world’s nations must be very specific in terms of wildlife conservation, the amount of wildlife
            is diminishing
            day by day. The World Wild Life Fund is a global organization that does
            a praiseworthy job of encouraging wildlife protection. National agencies are also involved in wildlife
            conservation.
